    <div class="question">What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have.
      How did you solve those problems?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Somehow, I managed to miss the first step (tardiness, both times!) in getting Handlebars to work in both lectures
      it was discussed. Luckily, there are plenty of resources posted to the class website that I was able to follow and
      get back on track thanks to.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="question">How do you plan to use the tools you learned about in this assignment?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Handlebars will be the way we serve up all the data in our final project, how cool! Similar to the example photos
      pages and "posts" from Benny's list, our pieces of data will be "projects" and their associated metadata. I'm
      excited to use some Handlebars helper conditionals to enrich the individually generated project pages!

    <div class="question">What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have.
      How did you solve those problems?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      I have never worked with node.js before and I always really wanted to learn about it. I'm also not very keen with
      a terminal, so I learned a lot about how it is used this week as well. The step-by-step process laid out in our
      lectures this week were very helpful in both of these regards.

    <br>
    <div class="question">What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you
      find that you already knew?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      I now understand another way of serving a website, I imagine that this is one way some websites maintain a large
      scale without having to update a whole lot of duplicate code. When constructing an HTTP response, headers could be
      shared between different pages for example.

    <div class="answer">
      Like I'm sure many others experienced, the filtering task was nontrivial. The actual manipulation of the DOM was
      not the challenge in my case, that bit was fairly simple (tokenize the posts, save a list, work off of that). It
      was the actual logic of the filter that I was struggling with a tiny bit - until I read the instructions a little
      more closely and found that I was over/underdoing it by having an inclusive filter instead of an exclusive one as was
      required.

    <div class="question">What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you
      find that you already knew?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Finally understanding anonymous functions is a real game-changer!
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="question">Is there anything extra you added beyond the scope of the assignment?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      I added a little quality of life improvement to the filtering system, if the user presses 'Enter' in any of
      the text entry areas (text, min or max price), the filter will update as if they pressed the 'Update' button in
      the filter dialog. I did this by adding a keypress listener to those elements and calling the update filter
      function if the key pressed is 'Enter.'

    <div class="answer">
      The most challenging thing for me was getting a good idea of the scale of the mockups, but this was only a minor
      issue! Viewing the mockups in my browser instead of using the lackluster Windows image viewer app made the goal of
      a 1-to-1 recreation easier.

    <div class="question">What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you
      find that you already knew?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      I never looked too deeply into selectors and combinators when I was learning CSS back in the day, so I kind of
      went wild with them on this assignment to get some experience in!
      <br>
      Another new thing to me were flexboxes, what a handy tool they are. I will be using them a lot going forward!
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="question">What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most
      helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>Classmates - A few ticky-tacky details were pointed out by some of my buddies in class, they helped me notice those details and correct them!</li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Backgrounds_and_Borders/Box-shadow_generator" target="_blank">MDN Box Shadow Generator</a> - A super handy tool that allowed me to graphically generate the drop shadow on the sell item button (+)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="question">What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>Cursor: I had to look up which cursor was the pointy-finger one, felt silly to find that it was called "pointer"</li>
        <li>Centering Images: This is something I've never managed to remember, so I had to look up how to center an img <em>again</em> for about the ten millionth time.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Entry #1</h3>
    <span class="date">9/27/2022</span>
  </div>
  <div class="blog_body">
    <div class="question">What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</div>
    <div class="answer">Consider my troubles a cautionary tale! I use WebStorm from JetBrains as my IDE, and it has GitHub integration; my first attempts to clone the assignment repository were met with an error saying that the repo "could not be found" when I attempted to do so through WebStorm. My solution was to clone using the SSH protocol, as suggested by a classmate.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="question">What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</div>
    <div class="answer">I've always been a little gun-shy about using terminal commands, but it was suggested that I get over myself and use git commands - and I'm glad I did!<br>
      Having done some amount of amateur web development, I am familiar with HTML, CSS, and JS <a class="secret" title='Did you know that PHP stands for "PHP: Hypertext Protocol"? It used to stand for "Personal Home Page" but the organization opted for a recursive acronym after a while!'>(also PHP, but don't tell anyone)</a></div>
    <br>
    <div class="question">What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> - This article was linked in our assignment README and taught me how to host my site for free on GitHub!</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> - I often refer back to this site when I forget the syntax or how something behaves in HTML, CSS, or JS! (I only used it for CSS this time around, specifically)</li>
        <li><a href="https://coolors.co/palettes/popular/9%20colors" target="_blank">Coolors</a> - I'm not great with color palettes, so I like to cheat a little and use this tool (and it's still not very congruent)</li>
        <li>CampusWire - As I mentioned above, one of our peers suggested that I use git commands and gave me some pointers about it.</li>
      </ul>
