  <p>Welcome to my code blog! This is where I will be posting my blog entries for class.</p>

  <div class="blog_title">
    <h3>Entry #2</h3>
    <span class="date">10/21/2022</span>
  </div>
  <div class="blog_body">
    <div class="question">What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have.
      How did you solve those problems?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      The most challenging thing for me was getting a good idea of the scale of the mockups, but this was only a minor
      issue! Viewing the mockups in my browser instead of using the lackluster Windows image viewer app made the goal of
      a 1-to-1 recreation easier.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="question">What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you
      find that you already knew?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      I never looked too deeply into selectors and combinators when I was learning CSS back in the day, so I kind of
      went wild with them on this assignment to get some experience in!
      <br>
      Another new thing to me were flexboxes, what a handy tool they are. I will be using them a lot going forward!
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="question">What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most
      helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>Classmates - A few ticky-tacky details were pointed out by some of my buddies in class, they helped me notice those details and correct them!</li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Backgrounds_and_Borders/Box-shadow_generator" target="_blank">MDN Box Shadow Generator</a> - A super handy tool that allowed me to graphically generate the drop shadow on the sell item button (+)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="question">What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>Cursor: I had to look up which cursor was the pointy-finger one, felt silly to find that it was called "pointer"</li>
        <li>Centering Images: This is something I've never managed to remember, so I had to look up how to center an img <em>again</em> for about the ten millionth time.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Entry #1</h3>
    <span class="date">9/27/2022</span>
  </div>
  <div class="blog_body">
    <div class="question">What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</div>
    <div class="answer">Consider my troubles a cautionary tale! I use WebStorm from JetBrains as my IDE, and it has GitHub integration; my first attempts to clone the assignment repository were met with an error saying that the repo "could not be found" when I attempted to do so through WebStorm. My solution was to clone using the SSH protocol, as suggested by a classmate.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="question">What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</div>
    <div class="answer">I've always been a little gun-shy about using terminal commands, but it was suggested that I get over myself and use git commands - and I'm glad I did!<br>
      Having done some amount of amateur web development, I am familiar with HTML, CSS, and JS <a class="secret" title='Did you know that PHP stands for "PHP: Hypertext Protocol"? It used to stand for "Personal Home Page" but the organization opted for a recursive acronym after a while!'>(also PHP, but don't tell anyone)</a></div>
    <br>
    <div class="question">What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> - This article was linked in our assignment README and taught me how to host my site for free on GitHub!</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> - I often refer back to this site when I forget the syntax or how something behaves in HTML, CSS, or JS! (I only used it for CSS this time around, specifically)</li>
        <li><a href="https://coolors.co/palettes/popular/9%20colors" target="_blank">Coolors</a> - I'm not great with color palettes, so I like to cheat a little and use this tool (and it's still not very congruent)</li>
        <li>CampusWire - As I mentioned above, one of our peers suggested that I use git commands and gave me some pointers about it.</li>
      </ul>
