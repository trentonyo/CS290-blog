  <p>Welcome to my code blog! This is where I will be posting my blog entries for class.</p>

    <div class="question">What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</div>
    <div class="answer">Consider my troubles a cautionary tale! I use WebStorm from JetBrains as my IDE, and it has GitHub integration; my first attempts to clone the assignment repository were met with an error saying that the repo "could not be found" when I attempted to do so through WebStorm. My solution was to do it by hand using git commands!</div>
    <br>
    <div class="question">What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</div>
    <div class="answer">I've always been a little gun-shy about using terminal commands, but it was suggested that I get over myself and use git commands - and I'm glad I did!<br>
    Having done some amount of amateur web development, I am familiar with HTML, CSS, and JS <a class="secret" title='Did you know that PHP stands for "PHP: Hypertext Protocol"? It used to stand for "Personal Home Page" but the organization opted for a recursive acronym after a while!'>(also PHP, but don't tell anyone)</a></div>
    <br>
    <div class="question">What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> - This article was linked in our assignment README and taught me how to host my site for free on GitHub!</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> - I often refer back to this site when I forget the syntax or how something behaves in HTML, CSS, or JS! (I only used it for CSS this time around, specifically)</li>
        <li><a href="https://coolors.co/palettes/popular/9%20colors" target="_blank">Coolors</a> - I'm not great with color palettes, so I like to cheat a little and use this tool (and it's still not very congruent)</li>
        <li>CampusWire - As I mentioned above, one of our peers suggested that I use git commands and gave me some pointers about it.</li>
