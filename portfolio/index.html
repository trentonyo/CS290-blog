        <p class="question">Do you play Minecraft? Do you play with mods? *Do you play with one of those giant modpacks
            and want to build cities using automation? Then this is the project for you!
        </p>
        <p class="answer">This is a prototype CAD tool that I wrote to generate build schematics for virtual robots in my
            Minecraft server. There is a 3-dimensional viewport, but you cannot edit the schematic any way other than
            editing the text box which represents the actual build plan.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            The virtual robot runs a program that essentially 3D prints the plan, each character in the plan corresponding
            to one of nine slots in its inventory and new layers are delineated by the octothorpe (#) character.
        </p>
