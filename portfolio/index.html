    <p>Here is where I'll host any projects I have (up to two!). As I find old projects, prototypes, and snippets I'll continue to add them here!</p>

        <p class="question">
            Are you a streamer? Do you remember the DVD player screen saver that bounced around? Then this is the project for you!
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            OBS allows you to use "website" sources in your virtual broadcast, which means that you can feed a webpage into your stream or virtual camera! This page
            displays a message and has it bouncing around the screen at a semi-random vector. The best part is when the text hits one of the corners (and there's a tracker for
            how many times it has done so).
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            This tool is super cool and fun, and also encourages viewer engagement because they can <em>interact with it!</em> Views can type "!faster" or "!slower" in your
            Twitch channel's chat to affect the speed of the message, and approved users can even change the message!

        <p class="question">
            Do you play Minecraft? Do you play with mods? *Do you play with one of those giant modpacks
            and want to build cities using automation? Then this is the project for you!
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            This is a prototype CAD tool that I wrote to generate build schematics for virtual robots in my
            Minecraft server. There is a 3-dimensional viewport, but you cannot edit the schematic any way other than
            editing the text box which represents the actual build plan.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
            The virtual robot runs a program that essentially 3D prints the plan, each character in the plan corresponding
            to one of nine slots in its inventory and new layers are delineated by the octothorpe (#) character.
