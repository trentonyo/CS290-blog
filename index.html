    <div class="question">What is the most complex or interesting thing you've done with your current web development skills?</div>
    <p class="answer">Recently, I started making a simple little CAD tool for designing projects to be built by virtual robots in Minecraft, I call it riceCAD. This project uses two libraries, PlayCanvas which gives me the simple 3D canvas and SaveAs which allows me to generate files to be saved locally.</p>
    <div class="question">What do you hope to learn from this class?</div>
    <p class="answer">I hope to get better at collaboration and understand a little big more about how to do WebDev the <i>right</i> way.</p>
    <div class="question">Have you signed up for our course Campuswire forum?</div>
    <p class="answer">Yes! Hope to have some good conversation there.</p>
    <div class="question">What is an interesting experience you've had?</div>
    <p class="answer">I was born and raised in Alaska, and the final exam in my eighth grade science class was to survive for three days on a remote island in southeast Alaska with nothing but a sheet of visqueen to sleep in and a cofee tin full of supplies. I went with the "toughie" group meaning that on top of the task of survival, we also spent one of our days hiking up a mountain and back as an added challenge.</p>
